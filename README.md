# racker-stacker

This application is used for building a simple plan when preparing a server or network rack. The goal for the final feature set of this application is:
- The ability to designate a single rack of a specific height (for example, 42u).
- The ability to add components of specific heights for placement within the rack (for example, a 1u, 2u, or 4u server)
- The ability to drag-and-drop components throughout the rack for placement.
- The ability to add a color-coded label to an individual component that indicates its class (compute, power, network, storage, cooling, etc)
- The ability to select two already-placed components in a rack plan and get a distance, in inches, between the two (for the purposes of cable planning)
- The ability to add text field data to a given component (device names, IP addresses, subnets)
- The ability to save a work-in-progress for later modification
- The ability to load a previously saved work-in-progress to allow further modification
- The ability to export to a spreadsheet
- The ability to export to a png
